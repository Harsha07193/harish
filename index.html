<!-- STORY -->
<section class="story">
    <p>
        And there are so many precious memories that aren't expressed by words.
        I still remember the day I saw you first. It was the day you became our CR.
        You were just wearing a college uniform and came out of your bench and stood there.
    </p>

    <p>
        That day I didn't know that you are the one who would play such an important role in my life.
        I didn't know that I would love you more than myself and anyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
        The day we first travelled together was also the day we fell in love completely.
        It is truly one of the best memories of us.
    </p>

    <p>
        That day I was really super excited to travel with you.
        It was my first time travelling with another person.

<h2>My dear kanna!</h2>

Till now we had lots of memories together and I just want you to recall them too.
That's why I made this surprise for you.

We came through many ups and downs and finally we came to a stage
where we can't live without each other.
